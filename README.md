# Rubiks-Cube-Solving-Robot

With the guidance by our professor, Dr. Matthew Eicholtz, a partner and I created a robot that can solve a Rubik's cube. 

The files needed are graphics.py, a graphic file created by Dr. Eicholtz, and Rubiks.py, a program with the purpose of running, solving, and sending the solving sequence to our arduino program.

This project also has an accompanying research paper, which I can send out if contacted.
